# SSSM
A C++ implementation of the spectral split-step method for solving the Schr√∂dinger equation with a potential.

The initial wave function Psi0(x, y) can be changed as well as the time independent potential(x, y) function.
Nonsensical potentials and wave functions might return nonsensical results.
