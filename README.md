# SSSM
A C++ implementation of the spectral split-step method for solving the Schrödinger equation with a potential.

The initial wave function Psi0(x, y) can be changed as well as the time-independent potential(x, y) function.
Note, nonsensical potentials and wave functions might produce nonsensical results.

For more information on the method, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-step_method
